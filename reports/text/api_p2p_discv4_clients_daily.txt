Significant decrease: The api_p2p_discv4_clients_daily headline total dropped sharply to 175 last week, down 471 (-72.9% WoW) from the previous week.

**Highlights**
- The headline weekly total saw a dramatic decline, falling by nearly three-quarters compared to the prior week.
- This drop is broad-based but is most pronounced in the largest client segments, with some segments bucking the trend and showing increases.
- The top movers chart reveals that Erigon, Nethermind, and Geth all saw substantial week-over-week gains, while the overall headline fell due to sharp declines or near-zero values in other segments.
- The overall trend over the past 8–12 weeks had been relatively stable until this sudden drop, suggesting a recent, acute event or reporting anomaly.

**Key numbers**
- Headline weekly total: 175 (down from 646 the previous week; -471 / -72.9% WoW).
- Top 5 movers by absolute change (last week vs prior week):
  - Erigon: +204 (270 vs 66)
  - Nethermind: +155 (220 vs 65)
  - Geth: +66 (91 vs 25)
  - Besu: +35 (49 vs 14)
  - Reth: +11 (15 vs 4)
- Despite these increases, the overall total plummeted, indicating that other segments (not in the top 5 movers) experienced major declines or were zeroed out.

**Drivers & notes**
- The sharp headline decrease is not explained by the top 5 segments, all of which increased; the drop is likely due to missing, suppressed, or anomalous data in other segments.
- Timing: The decline is isolated to the most recent week; prior weeks were stable.
- Caveat: The data may be affected by reporting gaps, changes in segment definitions, or other anomalies not visible in the top movers.

**Outlook / Watch next week**
- Monitor for a rebound or continued suppression in the headline total to determine if this was a one-off anomaly or a new trend.
- Investigate missing or zeroed segments to clarify the source of the headline drop.
- Review data collection and reporting processes for potential disruptions or changes affecting the most recent week.
